# Project Description

This is a flutter project where I replicated the homepage of Ashesi University, Ghana (https://www.ashesi.edu.gh). This project was in response to a comment someone pass that "Flutter is only for mobile development" and partly because a friend mentioned that I hadn't made any public projects in a while. Although, not all the features have been implemented and this clone is not pixel perfect, I am comfortable to leave it as it is for the time being so I can focus on the projects I have been developing in private repository. Feel free to clone and complete it if you want to challenge yourself.
